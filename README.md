# StraightforwardSchrodingerSimulation
A straightforward interactive simulation of the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation.

*SchrodingerVisualizationCanvas.py* is an interactive simulation of the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation on a finite domain. It solves for the evolution of the real and imaginary parts of the wavefunction of a single particle, with a given potential energy function. At any point, the user can pause to click and draw any of these three functions. Simulation can occur on either a bounded or periodic domain.

It uses [VisPy](http://vispy.org/) for the visualization and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) for calculations.
